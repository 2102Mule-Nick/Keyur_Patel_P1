# # Project 1 (Sport Management System)

For Project 1, I will be building a Java Rest API that integrates with several other applications through various methods. I cameup with the idea to make the Sport Management System, which will have few different parts to complete full application such as Portal, Registration, scheduling, Records, and Management applications. Portal will be the REST API which will have the user facing interface where users can interact with this project. 

## High-Level Functionality
  The Sport Management System allows helpful functionality to many end-users such as Tournament Admin, Team Admin, Players, to keep track of their sport performance, event Schedule, their performance, and much more. 
  Tournament Admin can create the tournament, approve the teams to join the tournament, add or remove the teams from tournament, schedule the events for the teams. They can also manage the players during the tournament. 
  Team Admin can create the team, add or remove the players, they can apply to be a part of the tournament, schedule for the training, practice or other meetings. Also keep track of the players performance, players and team scorecard. 
  Players can create the profile, edit their profile, delete their account, keep track of team and personal performance, they can view the upcoming events. Join team, remove from team, join tournament, remove from tournament.


## Applications to be implimented
- [ ] Portal App          (Publicly Facing REST API)
- [ ] Registration App    (Registration Logic)
- [ ] Scheduling App      (Scheduling Logic)
- [ ] Records App         (Game, Player, Team Records Logic)
- [ ] Management App      (Manage Team, Tournament, Players Logic)

## Features

- [ ] Documentation (all methods have basic documentation)
- [ ] Unit testing (100% coverage)
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] 1 Java application that will handle a publicly facing REST API
- [ ] 3 additional Java applications that will handle parts of the logic
- [ ] at least 2 of the applications communicate to one another using REST 
- [ ] at least 2 of the applications communicate to one another using SOAP
- [ ] at least 1 JMS Topic for applications to communicate
- [ ] at least 1 JMS Queue for applications to communicate

## Tech Stack

- [ ] Java

## Init Instructions

- Select a project idea and submit it to trainer for approval. Be sure to include:
  - The 4 applications that you will be using to hanlde buisness logic
  - Explination on how JMS, REST, and SOAP will be used
- Once approved, create a new repository within this organization (naming convention: `firstname_lastname_p1`)

## Presentation

- [ ] 5 minute live demonstration of project
